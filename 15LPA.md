🧭 4. What to Do Now — Step-by-Step Plan
Month 1: Polish Profile
Update resume → highlight backend logic, auth, optimization

LinkedIn revamp with keywords (“React”, “Node”, “TypeScript”, “System Design”)

Month 2–3: Apply + Upskill
Target product/startup roles via:

LinkedIn Jobs

Wellfound (ex-AngelList)

CutShort

Referral from ex-colleagues

Learn System Design (basics enough for LLD)

Finish 1–2 strong projects (hosted + on GitHub)

Month 4+: Interview Season
Start applying to companies targeting ₹12–15 LPA

Negotiate hard when you get offers

🧠 Pro Tip: Build Something Impressive
Instead of just talking, build a strong project and deploy it:

Add auth, payment, role-based access, dashboard, SEO

Host it → Link in resume → You stand out from 90% of applicants

Projects + problem solving + confidence = 15 LPA weapon.
